      WineVybes was an amazing project experience where we were given a critera and told to try out best with our newly found skills. It was a nice experience with a nice group. It definitley a eye opening experience on how to work togeher as a team. We almost felt as he black horse team but we put out heads down and grinded it out together for a great project.
